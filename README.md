RengaBit - client
=================

RengaBit - Creative collaboration - just a right click away.

RengaBit allows you to simply work, we keep track of the precess for you. It’s a sub-version management system, your work process doesn’t change.

RengaBit is...
--------------

* Version control  
Save Milestones (versions) of your files and folders as they develop.
View these Milestones and return to a Milestone  easily. In order to 
reduce required disk space (Up to 90%) RengaBit saves only the 
differences between the versions. 

* Sharing tool  
Share your work directly with colleagues or friend with “RengaShare”; 
Peer to Peer file sharing. You can share any file, regardless of its 
size, with anyone, any time. We do not keep your files, we don’t have 
a “cloud”. Your files are private and protected.

* Comments & Suggestion tool  
Write a comment or add a suggestion to projects that people share 
with you.

* Desktop Syncing & Managing App  
You can manage the different versions and “paths” that your project 
took inside your file system. It’s “just a right-click away”.

* Project Collaboration & Management Platform  
To access your files from your tablet, mobile or any other device, 
all you need is a browser. The RengaBit website allows you to get an 
infographic view of your project’s progress.
